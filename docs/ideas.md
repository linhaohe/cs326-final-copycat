### Innovative Idea

Our project will be focusing on building a data management web application for an existing music player. The potential users of this application are admins, data engineers, and user support. The web application will display the data from the SQL database; the data consists of individual artists, playlists, songs, song cover images, and genre. After the data are displayed, the user is able to add, edit, and delete from the corresponding database. The user is also able to perform actions such as filtering, sorting, and exporting on the current grid through the web application.

### Important Components

The important components we will be implementing are the grid to display SQL data. The toolbox allows users to quickly perform a filter, export, sort, add, delete, and edit on the existing grid. The sidebar displays the existing SQL tables in the database.
