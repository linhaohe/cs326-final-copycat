![Dashboard Page Screenshot](./milestone1_screenshots/DashboardPageScreenshot.png)

This is the main page of the web application. 
The sidebar will have links to every page the user want to access on the web app. It is togglable to show/hide with the hamburger menu button on the top left corner of the page. <br>
The main page content is the dashboard. It shows all types of actions the user has done on the web application. The types of actions are categorized into 5 different main sections: Add, Delete, Edit, Export, and Select/Search. There will be several activity graphs on the dashboard that shows the amount of actions the user has done in a given time period and the types of actions they did. The user could select to see the number of actions they did in the past year, past month, past week, etc. by clicking on the appropriate button.

In this page, the user can see the timestamps of each action they had done previously. Similar to the data presented in the dashboard, the data are separated into 5 different main sections. The user could select onto one of the tabs on the right to view specifically the timesheet data of that action. The data in this page would be much more specific than those presented on the dashboard with specific timestamps.
