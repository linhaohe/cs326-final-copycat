### To run the program locally:
Run the following commands in the root path of this project to start the web app: <br>
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then in the browser, go to
```
http://localhost:3000
```
to get to the login page. <br>
<br>

Note: As of now, the login authentication for the website is not set up, since it is not a requirement for milestone 2. So go to
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```
to reach the dashboard of the web application instead.
